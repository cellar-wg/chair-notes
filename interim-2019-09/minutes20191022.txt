4. WG status update
   * EBML -- version 13 was posted 2019-10-22, waiting for AD.
   * FFV1  -- version 10 was posted 2019-10-10, waiting for AD.

5. Interest in using gerrithub.io?
   For non-CLI uses, github has limitations lacking a web-based rebase
   process.  http://gerrithub.io/

6. Work on Matroska issues.
  ** now that EBML has provided the side-data container, we can start adding side-data types to Matroska.
  ** Google (WEBM) has created some new blocks (for HDR information) in the container, and we need to make sure we do not collide.     https://github.com/cellar-wg/matroska-specification/issues/345
		*** can we get them to coordinate better?
		*** now it is finished, but we need to try again.  We could say that values up to 10 are reserved.

EBML issue: implementation note default? publish a new version?
mcr: says go ahead with new version as you wish.

FFV1: still waiting, but there are some issues raised by new decoder for v3. And we should clarify the text.


7. Any other business.

NEXT meeting is 2019-12-03 moved to 2019-12-10.
