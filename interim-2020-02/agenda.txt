5. WG status update
   * EBML -- version 17 was posted 2020-01-27
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-ebml/writeup/
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-ebml/ballot/

    -17 believed to address all DISCUSS comments now.

   * FFV1 -- version 12 was posted 2020-1-28. Going to Adam Roach responsible AD
				   doing review.

    - some issues made. Work is half-done.
    - Jerome will take the next move to close some of the To do items.

6. Work on Matroska issues.

** Start New Chapters Pull Request.
-> Conclusion that splitting chapters off into new document is not worth the effort.

*** does not validate yet, but working on it.  More Text to explain what Chapters do.
*** pull request was too big, and has been split off into smaller chunks to absorb.

Discussion: do we need some diagrams, etc. for the next meeting?
No: just go through some issues and deal with some concrete pull requests.
Updated, issue #354, that was lingering for some time because of EBML path format, which is now clear in -17 of EBML, so now we can merge it.  It changes half of the lines in the document, so need to do this now.

7. Any other business.

Next meeting: 2020-02-25.

5. WG status update
   * EBML -- version 14 was posted 2019-12-02, on IESG telechat for 2019-12-05
               --- deferred as document was too long for some IESG membes to get a handle on
   * FFV1 -- version 11 was posted 2019-10-23, waiting for AD writeup.

Dave Rice reports that changes that occured today was as a result of a review; some figures and tables are now cross-referenced more clearly.
The same was done to ffv1.  Some help is needed to get appropriate captions on the tables.
Robert Sparks asks that new versions not be updated until there are replies and instructions.
ACTION: MCR to followup with Robert Sparks on IANA issue.
  -> EBML is a "general purpose audio/video container"  Steve to fix #304.

6. Work on Matroska issues.

Split the main Matroska document to take the Chapters in another document?
Only elements required for proper playback should be in the main document.
Document 166 pages today.
Chapters is 6 pages, section 11.  --- but the section is not finished.
Core document 9.3.4 "Tracks" is pages 45->106.

MCR: hears support for splitting the chapter off, but asks if there is really that much savings.
Steve: we could make the document smaller by grouping things that have only one parent or one child, with some better transformation of the formatting.


The chapters section is not finished, and there are lot of incomplete sections which will
make the section significantly larger, and so splitting it off into another document may still be justified.
It makes no sense to work on it now, but make the split off now.
Steve will give it a try and see what the savings is, and if we have a lot references that break, but does not think that this is the case.
Dave Rice is hesistant, not sure he sees enough of an advantage.
Tags and Meta-data are developed asynchronously, but the chapters are not going to evolve in place.
This issue will be deferred.

Peter B:
        ffv1 support in davinci / black-magic.  Would rather do this after the document is published. What is status?
        did Derek's feedback about the implementation in GO make it back into the document.
        DR: Yes, this went back into the document about three months ago.  This resulted in a few issues being created, and the review was very helpful.

Noting that there are three decoders: ffmpeg, Derek-GO, and Jerome's decoder

7. Any other business.

7.1  Side Data Format for MKV
        Benjamin: side data format for MKV!
        Dave Rice: it is merged into Matroska, can add side data to frames.
        Three competing things how to encode time code into the file. Related discussion at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/cellar/?q=matroska%20and%20side%20data%20vs%20timecode.
        1) use side data. A debated proposal is at https://github.com/cellar-wg/matroska-specification/pull/348. (needsd to mentioned in main document) A sample of matroska with side data timecode is at https://github.com/Matroska-Org/matroska-test-files/pull/5.
        2) meta-data tag or segment info(needs to be in main document)
        3) seperate track (codec-like document)




NEXT meeting is 2020-01-28,
