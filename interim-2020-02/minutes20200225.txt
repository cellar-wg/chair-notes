      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-ebml/writeup/
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-ebml/ballot/

    -17 believed to address all DISCUSS comments now.

   * FFV1 -- version 12 was posted 2020-1-28. Going to Adam Roach responsible AD
                                   doing review.

    - some issues made. Work is half-done.
    - Jerome will take the next move to close some of the To do items.

6. Work on Matroska issues.

** Start New Chapters Pull Request.
-> Conclusion that splitting chapters off into new document is not worth the effort.

*** does not validate yet, but working on it.  More Text to explain what Chapters do.
*** pull request was too big, and has been split off into smaller chunks to absorb.

Discussion: do we need some diagrams, etc. for the next meeting?
No: just go through some issues and deal with some concrete pull requests.
Updated, issue #354, that was lingering for some time because of EBML path format, which is now clear in -17 of EBML, so now we can merge it.  It changes half of the lines in the document, so need to do this now.

7. Any other business.

Next meeting: 2020-02-25.
