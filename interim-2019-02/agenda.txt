5. Dave Rice on updates to EBML to address AD comments.
	- EBML draft is now updated to version 09 as of the 24th
	- There's already many updates in github since 09, since version 10 will be very soon
	- I'd say that about 90% of the AD review is resolved, with a few more either to do
	or in the pull request section to be finalized
	- Yep typing away


6. Steve LHomme on Matroska document changes since last meeting.

 - split webm and divX out of this document
 - not extensions in the ebml sense.
 - we use fields in matroska which are not valid EBML, so we need to define them in the Matroska document.
 - need a way to process the extra profiles
 -

7. WG plans for advancing documents.

  - ffv1 version 0,1,3 ---> WGLC?
  - Michael finished the missing pieces, so now we are ready for more review.
  - All remaining issues are for version 4.
  - No relationship to Matroska document.
  - Peter B may have offered in the past.  Peter Bubestinger <p.bubestinger@av-rd.com>

* FLAC needs some work to turn it into an IETF-style specification.
* Matroska is the new focus.
