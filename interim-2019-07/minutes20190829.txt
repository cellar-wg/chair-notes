	        4. WG status update
	           * EBML -- still waiting on revised -11 document for AD evaluation.
	        ACTION from last time:
	                       ==> issue #257, requested one more day to think about it.
	                                                The changes
	                    are fine in general, but want to make sure it precise enough. (MB)
	
	        We created issue #279 to introduce some new text to better explain what a Global Element is, and why it does not end an unlimited size Element.
	
	           * Thank for reposting of draft-ietf-cellar-tags-02,
	                 draft-ietf-cellar-matroska-03  and draft-ietf-cellar-codec-02
	
	           * The personal draft-weaver-cellar-flac-00 did not get reposted.
	             I believe that we adopted it, so it should have been reposted with a
	             draft-ietf-cellar-flac-00!
	
	        reposted today, thank you.
	
	        5. Any remining EBML issues.
	
	        none known.
	
	        6. ffv1-07 could be reposted in v3 format.
	        ACTION: mcr to ask DataTracker and RSE if they are ready for this.
	
	        7. Work on Matroska issues.
	
	        Closed issue #325 (merged).
	        Discussed issue #334 and related issue #308.
	
	        8. Any other business.
	
	        Matroska Pull request #318 will be on the agenda for next time.
	
	        Meeting will be moved to an hour earlier, until the time changes.
	        Currently it is 23:00 Berlin, so we will anchor the meeting to 22:00 Berlin time.
