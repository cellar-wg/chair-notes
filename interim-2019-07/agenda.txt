	   * EBML -- still waiting on revised -11 document for AD evaluation.
	ACTION from last time:
	               ==> issue #257, requested one more day to think about it.
						The changes
	            are fine in general, but want to make sure it precise enough. (MB)

	We created issue #279 to introduce some new text to better explain what a Global Element is, and why it does not end an unlimited size Element.

	   * Thank for reposting of draft-ietf-cellar-tags-02,
	         draft-ietf-cellar-matroska-03  and draft-ietf-cellar-codec-02

	   * The personal draft-weaver-cellar-flac-00 did not get reposted.
	     I believe that we adopted it, so it should have been reposted with a
	     draft-ietf-cellar-flac-00!

	reposted today, thank you.

	5. Any remining EBML issues.

	none known.

	6. ffv1-07 could be reposted in v3 format.
